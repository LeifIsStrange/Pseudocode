# General
Pseudocode is a dynamically typed, imperative programming language that focuses on readability and a broad selection of common features.
 - Specific informations about all features are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/xtay2/Pseudocode-II/wiki).
 - The language features a custom [syntaxhighlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xtay.pseudocode-lang) for VSCode.

## Download
Download the current version of the pre-Alpha Interpreter here:
 - <em>Currently not available.</em>

### Execution (Windows)
 - Download the interpreter-package. (zip-Archive)
 - Unpack it somewhere.
 - Execute the "Install.bat"-File.
 - The interpreter-package should have vanished by now.
 - "pc" is now added to the system-path.
 - Create a new project that contains exactly one file titled "Main.pc"
 - Navigate to the location of the project in cmd and run the command "pc run" or just "pc r".
 - The project should now get build and executed.

## Important Sidenotes
 - Please report any bug or unexpected behaviour by filling out [this](https://github.com/xtay2/Pseudocode-II/issues/new/choose) short form. It helps a lot!
 - If you alter the standard-library (stdlib) in any way, the interpreter is no longer usable.
 - The interpreter requires atleast java [jdk 17.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and will ask the user to install it, if the version is too old or not accessible.
