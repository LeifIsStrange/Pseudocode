## What is Peudocode ?

Pseudocode is a highlevel language with easy to read syntax. This extension enables VSCode to find ".ps" files and applies a syntaxhighlighting to them. The pseudo-dark theme is a modified variant of the dark + theme and promises even better syntax highlighting, but also supports everything the standard-dark theme does.
