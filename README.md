# Pseudocode-II
An imperative Programming Language

## Language Philosophy
- The syntax should be easy to read.
- This language should contain most of the general features of popular languages.
- Features and Syntax are inspired by Python, Java and C-like-languages, so that an easy entry, irregardless of the user past experience, is possible.
- Syntactic sugar is allways welcome.
- There is never just one way to do something.
- Combined features rock!
- Rather use keywords than combinations of symbols.
- The code can shape the language.
- The formatter can shape the code.
