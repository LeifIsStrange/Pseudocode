### Language Philosophy
- The syntax should be easy to read.
- This language should contain most of the general features of popular languages.
- Features and Syntax are inspired by Python, Java and C-like-languages, so that an easy entry, irregardless of the users past experience, is possible.
- Syntactic sugar is allways welcome.
- There is never just one way to do something.
- Combined features rock!
- Rather use keywords than combinations of symbols.
- The code can shape the language.
- The formatter can shape the code.

### Community
- Feature or pull-requests are allways welcome.
- Please report any bugs/unexpected behaviour that you encounter.
- A download-/executable interpreter-file will be available soon.
